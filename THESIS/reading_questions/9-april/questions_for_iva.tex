\item I am having difficulty defining direct sum and tensor product on commutative rings with identity. If I define it for modules, it seems that in order to extend it to rings, I must show that if the initial modules have a ring multiplication (and multiplicative identity), then the tensor product also adopts a ring multiplication (and multiplicative identity). This seems tricky though. It seems for the direct sum, I will have to ditch the promise of a multiplicative identity. I am not sure how this plays out for tensor product.

\item Is there a good introductory example of a functor? For a covariant functor, I can do a forgetful functor.

\item I am considering including a brief summary/introductionish at the beginning that will likely have material comparable 

\item It terms of material, what should I aim to get through for the presentation.
