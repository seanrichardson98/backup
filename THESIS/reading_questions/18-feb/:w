\maketitle

Hi Iva! I re-read the bottom of 53, and read pages 54 and 55. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item After some googling, I learned that over groups, the direct sum $\op$ and the tensor products $\ot$ distribute over groups and further it seems that $\Z$ acts as some kind of ``multiplicative identity'' for the tensor product. This seems to be used multiple times in the 
    \item More googling led me to find this thing called the ``Splitting Lemma'', which I think Hatcher assumes I know. It seems this lemma is used multiple times 
    \item Also, Hatcher mentions $\RK(S^2)$ is infinite cyclic, which is a very important part of the proof for Bott Periodicity and is used later. I am not sure why this is true. At a glance, it seems likely that this comes from somewhere in the 42 --- 51 page range that Hatcher kind of promised me I could skip.
\end{enumerate}
