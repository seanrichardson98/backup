The make-a-shape-simpler approach helps you tell if two shapes are different. This approach begins by taking a fixed shape and then tries to put flat worlds onto the surface of the shape. This gives a big set of different ways to put flat worlds on the shape, and each of these ways gives a bigger shape that holds the fixed shape inside. After some changing, it is possible to add together two different shape-holders, and take one shape-holder times another shape holder. Every shape-holder even has another shape-holder friend so that they add to nothing. Sometimes it is hard to tell if two shapes are the same, but it is easier to look at how the shape-holders of the two different shapes add together. If shape-holders add together in very different ways, then the two shapes are not the same.
