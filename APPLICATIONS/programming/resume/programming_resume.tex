% \begin{rSection}{Career Interests}
%     \textbf{Teaching:}
%     I find particular enjoyment in working as a tutor, which motivates my
%     career interest of teaching. I would enjoy teaching at any level, but
%     teaching at the university level best aligns with my research interests.\\
%     \textbf{Further Education \& Research:}
%     I am interested in pursuing education in mathematics to the Ph.D level.
%     I have a particular interest in the mathematical branch of
%     differential geometry, which I would enjoy pursuing research in.

%\begin{rSection}{Research Experience}
%\textbf{3-Orbifolds and their Laplace Spectra} \hfill \textit{Summer
%2018}\\
%This research project considers abstract geometrical constructions called
%'orbifolds' (a generalization of a manifold) and asks: if it is only known
%at what frequencies some unknown orbifold vibrates at (formally the Laplace
%Spectra), what properties can we deduce about the orbifold? We found such a
%property, which we call ``local orientability''.
%
%\textbf{Identifying Clouds with Convolutional Neural Networks} \hfill
%\textit{Summer 2017}\\
%Our team worked towards an automated process to identify clouds in images
%of the sky, which could assist climate scientists. We
%implemented and trained a convolution neural network that can take a
%picture of the sky as input and distinguish between clear, thin cloud, and
%thick cloud pixels with 94\% accuracy.
