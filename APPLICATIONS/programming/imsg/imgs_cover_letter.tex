I am writing to apply for the Scientific Programmer position at I.M. Systems Group. My programming proficiency together with my experience in mathematics, physics, and research qualifies me for the position will make me a valuable contributor to the ASSISTT team.

I have direct experience with the listed duties and skills. A summer research project in identifying meteorological clouds provided experience managing data, preprocessing data, using Git with a team, writing shell scripts to automate training a neural network, and writing unit tests. However, I have a unique set of skills aside from the software development through graduating with a major in computer science \& mathematics and a second major in physics. My physics background will allow for a faster understanding of scientific concepts, but I put particular emphasis on my strength in mathematics. I have excelled in my mathematics studies and through research, I have published a new mathematics result in a peer reviewed journal. I will able to quickly learn the necessary mathematical concepts that the job requires. Additionally, years of tutoring experience has allowed me to clearly communicate complex ideas and my research experience may help in communicating with the research teams.

I will be graduating from Lewis \& Clark College in May and moving to the Rockville area this summer. I am available to start anytime following the first of June, but I would prefer to start in July. I am a U.S. citizen and would consider a salary of approximately \$50k for a year.

Regarding the references, Dr. Peter Drake of computer science led the cloud identification research project that I helped write the code for. Dr. Liz Stanhope of mathematics is a faculty advisor and collaborator in my published mathematics research work. Dr. Andrew Funk is my advisor for the physics major whom I have had in class and graded for.

I am excited to help tackle any complex problems that the ASSISTT team encounters. I would particular enjoy applying my programming and mathematics skills in a scientific environment that helps address environmental challenges.
