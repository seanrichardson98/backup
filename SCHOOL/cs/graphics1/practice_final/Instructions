    Instructions for the 2016 CS 367 Graphics Final Exam

1.  Login as kepler, password == kepler

2.  Use sftp to download any files you think you might need
    from your own account.

3.  sftp kepler@simpson1
    mget *.*   

        you should get the following files :

        drawXYZ.exec
 
        cylinder30_24.xyz
        cylinder40_96.xyz

        moebius30_24.xyz
        moebius40_96.xyz

        D3d_matrix.h
        D3d_matrix.c

        file_output_test.c

    quit  (exit out of sftp)
    ls    (list your files to make sure you got these)

4.  Disconnect yourself from the internet

5.  The file, drawXYZ.exec is a a program that can render .xyz files.
    You should test it out by running it on the four .xyz files
       listed above.

    You can run it via :

    ./drawXYZ.exec

    and it will give you a usage message.

    To display the file, cylinder30_24.xyz  you should

    ./drawXYZ.exec  600 600  100 200 0  cylinder30_24.xyz    1 0 0

    This will create a 600x600 screen, put the light at 100 200 0,
    load the desired .xyz file, and color it red (1 0 0),

    After that, if you hit the 'y' key it will rotate the object
    about y, the 'x' key will rotate it about x, and the 'z' key
    will rotate it about z.  The 'q' key will quit the program.

6.  After looking at all four .xyz files, here are some comments :
    
    Each object has been constructed along a circle of radius 100.

    The files cylinder30_24.xyz  and moebius30_24.xyz  have 24
    polygons, each with a depth of 30.

    The files cylinder40_96.xyz  and moebius40_96.xyz  have 96
    polygons, each with a depth of 40.

7.  Your task is to write a program that takes as input, FIRST the
    depth and THEN the number of polygons, and creates the proper
    moebius.xyz file so that the rendering program can draw it.
    Your moebius strips should have a "radius" of 100 as in the
    four .xyz files above.

    Notice that you are to create the moebius strips and not the
    cylinders.  The cylinders are there for comparison and to 
    suggest a first step along the way.  Partial credit will
    be given if you can create the cylinders but not the moebius
    strips but the goal is to create the moebius strips.

8.  Your program should be named as follows :
        yourfullnameGF16.c
    It is important that the name ends with GF16.c
    and that the GF is capitalized.

9.  When finished, put your name and your computer's name
    on a strip of paper and leave it on the keyboard.


10. If you have forgotten how to output information to a file,
    you should examine the program in  "file_output_test.c"

    You can compile it via

    cc  file_output_test.c

    and run it via

    ./a.out

    It should produce a file called  "test.xyz"  which you should
    examine and compare against the program.

11. There could be mild but acceptable variations on how you accomplish
    this task so you should not obsess on producing files that are 
    exact replicas of the examples.
