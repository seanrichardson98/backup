My first topic is on a cute geometric formulation called an orbitope.
Specifically, an orbitope is ``the convex hull of a compact group acting
linearly on a vector space''. I have two papers on oritopes attached. The paper
``orbitopes'' appears to be a more introductory paper to oritopes, but I would
hope to build towards the paper ``coadjoint orbitopes'', which extends the
idea into compact Lie groups. It seems all the literature on ``orbitopes'' is
fairly new, which hopefully means more accessible.\\


A second topic would focus on the attached paper ``Group Invariant Scattering''. This paper concerns the ``scattering'' transformation on the $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ space, but this paper seems to extend the idea to $L^2(G)$ for a compact Lie group $G$. My goal would be to get to section $5$ of this paper --- the section on this generalization to compact Lie groups.\\

Note: I believe all attached articles are published, but I could not get access to the official published version of ``Orbitopes'', so I have attached the arXiv version.
